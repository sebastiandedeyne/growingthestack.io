Steven Sinofsky started a Twitter thread about a company's writing culture. In this article, he annotates that thread with further articulation.

> The biggest thing about writing down strategic choices is that they serve to build a corporate history (over a year or two, not really thinking about decades). Why decisions are made is rather important because companies, like people, can make the same mistakes over time without history.

This paragraph resonated hard with me, not related to company strategies, but to code. I've been working on a few larger projects the past year, the kinds that require decisions which aren't clear "rights or wrongs", but benefits and tradeoffs.

It's important to be able to look back at those decisions. They can be critical for the future of the project; *"Why did we create this abstraction? Can't we just refactor it to something simpler?"* A written account could answer that question that in a heartbeat. Or maybe you need to make a similar decision in a different project: your documentation would allow you to hop back in to the decision-making process instead of starting from scratch.
