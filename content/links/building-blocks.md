Functional programming fascinates me. In many cases, a functional solution feels like a better solution to day-to-day programming problems, but it's hard to fully apply them in an object oriented language.

That said, keeping some core FP ideas in mind will help you write cleaner code in any environment. Steven Vandevelde explains a few basic concepts accompanied by beautiful illustrations to visualize it all with Lego blocks.

> This is a more visual approach to the topic of purely-typed functional programming. What does it mean to have a “functional” programming language? What are types? What makes a functional-programming language “pure”? These are the questions we will answer here, with a focus on simplicity.
