Matthias Noback‚Äîwho has managed to blog consistently every week this year üòØ‚Äîshares his experience applying ‚Äúconsistency‚Äù rules to his objects.

> When you create an object, it should be complete, consistent and valid in one go.

In the post, a geolocation service gets a refactoring treatment. Matthias goes through multiple iterations, each with their own tradeoffs.

> It is derived from the more general principle that it should not be possible for an object to exist in an inconsistent state. I think this is a very important rule, one that will gradually lead everyone from the swamps of those dreaded ‚Äúanemic‚Äù domain models. However, the question still remains: what does all of this mean?

Despite the title, the beauty of this article isn‚Äôt in a quick guideline, but in the refactoring process that we get guided through.
