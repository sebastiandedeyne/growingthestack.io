Hidde de Vries, a freelance frontend developer from the Netherlands, had the honor to follow a lecture from no one else than Sir Tim Berners-Lee, inventor of the world wide web. Hidde recaps Sir Berners-Lee's talk about the history, current state and future of the web.

> Berners-Lee first showed a virtuous circle: if all goes well the web lets people publish, which inspires conversation and more publications. This is the utopian scenario and weâ€™ve seen a lot of this actually happen. The web community itself it s a great example of this, we teach each other stuff and good blogs inspire other people to start blogging.

The creator of the web warns about a dystopian future, where algorithms decide what we get to see on the web, which in turn narrows our view. It's time for a *redecentralised* web!
