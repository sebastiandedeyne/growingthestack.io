Amber Case expresses her frustrations towards the use of touchscreen in modern machines. Being software-driven, touchscreens are a lot more flexible than analog interfaces, but they come with their own tradeoffs.

> Serious interfaces — those that are repeatedly used by a knowledgeable professional and/or in potentially hazardous situations, should not be touchscreen based. If a touchscreen must be used, it should be embedded alongside a set of fixed, physical buttons that support muscle memory and single actions.

My takeaway is that we should stop making everything more “high-tech” for the sake of it, and shouldn’t be afraid to take a step back and evaluate our creations from first principles.
