Alex Russel, software engineer for Chrome and sometimes harsh critic about the state of web performance, talks about how we’re forsaking our users in favor of our shiny developer tools.

> “These tools let us move faster. Because we can iterate faster we’re delivering better experiences. […]”

> This argument substitutes good intentions and developer value (“moving faster”, “less complexity”) for questions about the lived experience of users. It also tends to do so without evidence. We’re meant to take it on faith that it will all work out if only the well intentioned people are never questioned about the trajectory of the outcomes.

These kind of conversations should happen on a case by case basis; it’s impossible to have meaningful discussion without context here. However, I do agree with the sentiment that our tunnel vision on developer experience (using heavy frameworks for no reason, pulling in a gazillion libraries,…) has a deteriorating effect on the user experience provided by our applications. We can and should do better.

> JavaScript is the web’s CO2. We need some of it, but too much puts the entire ecosystem at risk. Those who emit the most are furthest from suffering the consequences — until the ecosystem collapses.
