What a clickbaity title!

I fell for it though. Andrew Askins recounts his recent experience of buying the *Startup Watching* newsletter.

I'm not really into the startup world, but the way Andrew wrote this article, especially how transparent he was about the whole process, makes it a very compelling read.

> There are multiple privileges I was born into that made this process easier and I thought it would be good to discuss those. [...]
> I tried to become financially independent early on. But I also know that even if I empty my savings, and get into a catastrophic accident, my parents will do everything they can to help me. I donâ€™t ever want to put them in that situation, but even subconsciously having that helps me to take more risks.
