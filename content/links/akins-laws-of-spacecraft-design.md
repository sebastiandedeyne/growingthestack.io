Dave Akins wrote 42 laws you should abide by when building spacecrafts. I'm not planning to build a spaceship any time soon, but apparently there are a *lot* of similarities with web development. A few examples:

> - Engineering is done with numbers. Analysis without numbers is only an opinion.
> - Design is based on requirements. There's no justification for designing something one bit “better“ than the requirements dictate.
> - Don't do nuthin' dumb.
> - Space is a completely unforgiving environment. If you screw up the engineering, somebody dies

Well, that last one is absolutely *not* applicable to the average web developer, but it's a good one to keep it this in mind next time something goes wrong in production.
